The `useUser` hook provided by @useawards/react-dom allows you to access the currently logged in user in your React components. Here is how to use it:

## Usage

```jsx
import { useUser } from '@useawards/react-dom';

function MyComponent() {
  const user = useUser();

  return (
    <div>
      {user ? (
        <div>Welcome, {user.name}!</div>
      ) : (
        <div>Please log in to continue.</div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

The `useUser` hook returns the current user object, which includes the name and email properties. If no user is currently logged in, the hook will return null.

You can use the `useUser` hook anywhere within a component tree that is wrapped in the UseawardsProvider. If there is no UseawardsProvider in the tree, the useUser hook will throw an error.

The `useUserAuthorize` hook allows you to authorize a user in the Useawards system. It returns a function that takes an object with a user's name and email properties as arguments. This function either retrieves an existing user from the browser's local storage or creates a new one with the given name and email.

## Usage
Here's an example of how to use the useUserAuthorize hook in a React component:

```jsx
import { useUserAuthorize } from "@useawards/react-dom";
import React from "react";

export function Authorize() {
  const authorize = useUserAuthorize();

  const handleAuthorize = async () => {
    await authorize({
      name: 'John Doe',
      email: 'john@mail.com'
    })
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleAuthorize}>Authorize</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

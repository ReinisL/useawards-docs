The `useFetchPrizes` hook is used to fetch and return a list of prizes from the UseAwards API. It takes no arguments and returns an array with two values: an array of prizes and a boolean indicating whether the prizes are still being loaded.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the useFetchPrizes hook in a React component:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { useFetchPrizes } from "@useawards/react-dom";

export function Prizes() {
  const [prizes, isLoading] = useFetchPrizes();

  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading prizes...</div>;
  }

  if (!prizes) {
    return <div>Error fetching prizes</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {prizes.map((prize) => (
        <div key={prize.id}>{prize.name}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

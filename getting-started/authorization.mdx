## Authorization
Before using the Useawards SDK, you need to authorize the user to access your Useawards account. You can do this by generating an API key in your Useawards account dashboard and providing it to your application.

To generate an API key, log in to your Useawards account and go to the "API Keys" section in the dashboard. Create a new API key and copy the key value.
